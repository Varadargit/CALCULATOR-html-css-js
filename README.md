# CALCULATOR-html-css-js
 The Simple Calculator project is a web-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is designed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
HTML: The layout consists of buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). These elements are arranged within a clean and intuitive interface using basic HTML tags.

CSS: The design of the calculator is enhanced with CSS, ensuring the buttons are well-organized and visually appealing. Responsive styling is applied to ensure the calculator is usable on both desktop and mobile screens.

JavaScript: The functionality of the calculator is powered by JavaScript. It handles user input, processes arithmetic operations, and displays results dynamically. JavaScript functions are used to handle button clicks, store and manipulate data, and calculate the result when the equals button is pressed.

Features:
Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear button (C): Resets the input and clears the display.
Responsive Design: Works across various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
Real-time calculations: Displays the ongoing calculation as the user clicks buttons, with the final result shown when "=" is pressed.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure of the calculator.
CSS: For styling and creating a user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic behind the calculations.
This project is a great starting point for learning how to build interactive web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how these three technologies can work together to create a functional, user-friendly tool.
